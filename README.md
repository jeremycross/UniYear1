# UniYear1
All my academic projects that were created in my first year of university.
All programs are written in c, in intermediate programming makefiles are used for compilation.  
  
The Beginner programs were made in my introduction to C course in University.  
The 'Labs' folder contains programs that were used as very simple introductions to concepts in C.
The 'Assignments' folder contains programs that were slightly larger in scale, however, were still quite simple.  
Assignment 1 - Grade Calculator  
Assignment 2 -  
Assignment 3 - Tic-Tac-Toe AI
