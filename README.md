# UniYear1
All my academic projects that were created in my first year of university.
All programs are written in c, in intermediate programming makefiles are used for compilation.  
  
**Beginner Programming**  
The Beginner programs were made in my introduction to C course in University.  
The 'labs' folder contains programs that were used as very simple introductions to concepts/syntax in C.
The 'assignments' folder contains programs that were slightly larger in scale, however, were still quite simple. The purpose of each assignment is as follows:   
  
Assignment 1 - Grade Calculator  
Assignment 2 - Who Wants to be a Millonaire Text-based Game  
Assignment 3 - Tic-Tac-Toe AI  
  
**Intermediate Programming**  
The Intermediate programs were made in my Intermediate C programming course in University.  
This course also introduced Makefiles which were included in each submission for compilation.  
The 'Labs' folder contains programs which were to take approximately 1-2 hours to complete and mainly focused on using a concept practically. The topics of the labs are as follows:  
  
Lab 1 - Analyse inputted poem from user (outputs: number of words per line and sum of words)  
Lab 2 - Reverse an inputted poem with dynamic allocation of the poem (outputs: the inputted poem with end line first and continuing)  
Lab 3 - Student record using structs and dynamic allocation  
Lab 4 - Working with function pointers and sorting arrays  
  
The 'Assignments' folder contains projects that were generally completed within a 6-10 hour window. The purpose of each assignment is as follows:  
  
Assignment 1 - Test harness program that allows dynamic allocation of arrays   
Assignment 2 - Calculate the Flesch index (readability) of written work  
Assignment 3 - 
Assignment 4 -
